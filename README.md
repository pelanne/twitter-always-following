# Twitter Always Following

Twitter recently made the For You tab the default on pageload, which was easy to overlook.  This extension automatically puts you in the Following tab on pageload without you needing to remember to go there.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Move the twitter-always-following-extension to some convenient location on your system.
3. visit chrome://extensions in your browser
4. enable developer mode (top right)
5. click "Load Unpacked" (top left) and select the twitter-always-following-extension folder

After installation, the home tab should always load in the  Following tab.
